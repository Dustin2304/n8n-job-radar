# Job Radar
A personal job radar for junior-to-mid roles that scrapes Indeed and LinkedIn via `python-jobspy`, filters and scores matches deterministically, and exposes the result as JSON for an n8n downstream consumer.

## What This Project Does
- Scrapes listings from Indeed and LinkedIn through `python-jobspy`.
- Runs profile-based keyword searches from `config.yaml` across configured locations.
- Excludes senior, internship, trainee, and other unwanted title patterns before scoring.
- Scores remaining jobs with a rule-based `0-100` relevance model and applies profile-specific thresholds.
- Serves fresh, cached, and aggregated results through FastAPI endpoints backed by a local JSON cache.

## Architecture
```text
config.yaml --> scraper --> filter (exclude + profile-match) --> scorer --> threshold gate --> /jobs ----------+
                  |                                                                          |                  |
                  +--> jobspy (indeed/linkedin)                              JSON cache <----+                  |
                                                                                                                 v
                                                                                              n8n workflow --> Ollama reranking --> HTML email
```
The API scoring step is rule-based on purpose: it is deterministic, free to run, and easy to test. That makes it a good fit for a local screening service with transparent ranking logic. Optional LLM-based reranking is included in the `n8n/` workflow as a downstream presentation layer, not as part of the API scoring logic.

## End-to-End Flow with n8n
The repository includes a sanitized workflow in `n8n/workflow.json`.

1. FastAPI runs a fresh scrape through `GET /jobs` and writes the local cache.
2. n8n reads the cached payload from `GET /jobs/cached`.
3. Jobs are flattened, split into batches, and scored again by a local Ollama model using a profile-specific prompt.
4. Relevant jobs are aggregated into a weekly HTML report and sent by email.

This split keeps the API deterministic and testable while still letting the final shortlist benefit from LLM-based prioritization.

## Setup
Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Unix shell:
```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Running
Start the API server and n8n together:
```powershell
scripts/run.ps1
```
```bash
scripts/run.sh
```

Both scripts start `n8n` and the FastAPI app together. They expect the `n8n` CLI to be installed and available in `PATH`.

Start only the API server:
```bash
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --port 8001
```

Run a scrape directly and print JSON to stdout:
```bash
python -m api.scraper
```

Run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/health` | `GET` | Health check |
| `/jobs` | `GET` | Runs a fresh scrape and writes the cache |
| `/jobs/cached` | `GET` | Returns the last cached scrape result |
| `/jobs/stats` | `GET` | Returns aggregates: `by_profile`, `by_source`, `watchlist_count` |

## Configuration
| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `locations[].city`, `radius_km`, `country` | Search area for each `jobspy` call |
| `scoring.threshold_it` | Minimum score for IT profiles; lower results are dropped |
| `scoring.threshold_non_it` | Minimum score for non-IT profiles with a higher hurdle |
| `profiles[].name`, `keywords`, `weight` | Search profile definition; `weight < 1.0` marks non-IT fallback profiles and reduces the effective score |
| `filters.exclude_title_keywords` | Extends the hardcoded senior and internship title filters |
| `companies` | Optional watchlist; matching jobs get `in_watchlist: true` and a score bonus |

## Scoring At a Glance
Each job starts at `30` points. Title matches add up to `35`, description matches add up to `25`, watchlist matches add `8`, and junior or entry-style titles add `5`. The profile `weight` is applied to the accumulated score, which lets non-IT fallback profiles rank lower without separate logic. All scoring rules live in `api/scorer.py` and can be adjusted without changing the API surface.

## Tests
11 unit tests cover scorer weighting, filter word boundaries, `nan` normalization, level inference, and model defaults. Run them with `pytest tests/ -v`.

## Limitations
- Focused on German/DACH search coverage, currently configured around Karlsruhe, Germany.
- Depends on `python-jobspy`, so rate limits and source-site markup changes can affect Indeed and LinkedIn scraping.
- No persistence layer beyond a local file cache.
- No authentication on the FastAPI endpoints; intended for local or internal use.
